# GUI Scale About
This is a cross platform GUI front-end for the Tailscale CLI. Currently, it's very basic, but there is an application built in iced (will be converting to libcosmic) and a COSMIC applet that can be added to the COSMIC desktop panel. For the applet, I will be creating a tutorial soon to show how to add applets to the COSMIC panel.
